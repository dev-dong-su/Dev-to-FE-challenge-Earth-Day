_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge v24.04.17](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-next-frontend-challenge-earth-day-edition-52e4), Glam Up My Markup: Earth Day Celebration Landing Page_

## What I Built
I created an interactive website featuring fun scroll events and simple fade animations. 

I used Figma to draw the Earth and people, and the website's colors are inspired by the colors of the Earth. 

I aimed for a design that is simple yet visually appealing and effectively communicates the message!

I implemented a section where a person flies in and hugs the Earth using scroll events and element positioning.

However, it was challenging because it behaved differently depending on the browser's height. 

Although the outcome was a bit different from what I initially envisioned, I still had fun and found it satisfying after several hours of work.
